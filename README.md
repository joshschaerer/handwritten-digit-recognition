## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

- **IDEAL**: Seamless digit recognition for all handwriting styles.
- **REALITY**: Varied handwriting styles lead to recognition challenges.
- **CONSEQUENCES**: Impacts data processing efficiency and user experience.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This project implements a convolutional neural network using Keras and TensorFlow, hosted on a Flask server, to improve the accuracy of recognizing handwritten digits. The interactive web application allows users to draw digits directly into a browser, which the model then evaluates in real-time.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- **Dependencies**: Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Keras, PIL, NumPy.
- **Limitations**: Performance can degrade with unusual handwriting or poor image quality.
- **Impact**: While effective, these limitations suggest room for further model training and refinement.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Potential future developments include enhancing the model to improve the accuracy of recognizing single digits and extending the model's capabilities to recognize sequences of multiple digits, which would significantly broaden its practical applications.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install flask tensorflow keras pillow numpy
```

### Installing

Clone the repository and navigate to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshschaerer/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

Run the Flask application:

```bash
flask run
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

After starting the server, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser. Use the drawing canvas to draw a digit with your mouse or touchscreen. The application will display the recognized digit and its confidence score.
